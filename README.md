A pokÃ¨mon inspired battler with turn based combat. The Green Knight logic works similar to the player, trying to defeat you with his attacks!
Try to win! 
- Single Attack 
- Lightning Attacks deals double the damage, but skips your after! The Green knight will take his revenge!
- The Block might defend you from the damage od the knight! Careful! {needs fixing!}
- Restart with the dedicated button or reload the page to start again!
- graphics inspired by classical nes games! 

Shoutout to nes.css creators. An awesome library to use for little gaming projects like this one.

** THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT MADE TO TEST MY UNDERSTANDING OF REACT NATIVE AND CANVAS WORKS. THIS GAME IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED OR BOUGHT **
